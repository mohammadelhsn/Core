# Core

This was my main Discord bot project, developed using TypeScript, Node.js, and Discord.js. The bot originally used MySQL for data storage before transitioning to PostgreSQL for improved performance and scalability. It was hosted on Heroku until the removal of the free tier, which led to discontinuation of the hosted service.
